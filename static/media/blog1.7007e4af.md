I cannot tell you how excited I am that this blog is finally up and running!
With the help of Github Pages and a good friend, [(check him out here)](https://github.com/nicklaslanman), I am now able to share daily tech updates, trends, and tutorials on some of the latest software.

## Whats a tech blog without even the tiniest bit of code 👏

```python
print("Hello World!")
```
```go
fmt.Println("Hello World!")
```

Be on the lookout for weekly (or sometimes daily) updates!
